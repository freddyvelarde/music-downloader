# Music Downloader

I decided to code my Youtube Music downloader.

## Getting started

To run this project on your local machine you need to use docker.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run the next command:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up
```

Once the Docker containers are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to:

```sh
http://192.168.0.9:8080
```
